# patchqtcore

This tool is based on single feature from [windeployqt](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html) and allows to remove hard-coded Qt prefix path. *patchqtcore* doesn't create any backup and shouldn't be used in Qt installation folder. To use starts the tool with *Qt5Core.dll* or *Qt5Cored.dll* as single argument. Pointed file will be modified. As usual silent is means success.
